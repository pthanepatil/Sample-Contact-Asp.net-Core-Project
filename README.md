# Sample-Contact-Asp.net-Core-Project

Below are uploaded files for verification:
1. Database Project: 
	DB Project which contains schema for tables and stored procedures need to be executed.
	Also execute data script file included in Project.
2. Asp.Net Core solution: 
	Complied, tested and running project with only need of initial database connection string configuration in "appsettings.json" file of EvolentContact.API project.
	
These are only manual configurations to be done for project to run.
